File: pihwm.info,  Node: Preparation,  Next: Configuring the Build,  Up: Installation

1.1 Preparation
===============

Unpack the software and create a _separate_ directory in which to build
it:

     tar jxf pihwm-2012-09-25.tar.bz2
     cd pihwm-2012-09-25
     mkdir bd
     cd bd

Alternatively, the latest version software may be cloned from git:

     git clone git://github.com/embecosm/pihwm.git
     cd pihwm
     mkdir bd
     cd bd


File: pihwm.info,  Node: Configuring the Build,  Next: Build and Install,  Prev: Preparation,  Up: Installation

1.2 Configuring the Build
=========================

Configure the software using the `configure' script in the main
directory.

     ../configure

There are several options available, many of which are standard to GNU
`configure' scripts.  Use `configure --help' to see all the options.
The most useful is `--prefix' to specify a directory for installation
of the library.


File: pihwm.info,  Node: Build and Install,  Next: Usage,  Prev: Configuring the Build,  Up: Installation

1.3 Building and Installing
===========================

Build the tool with:

     make all

If you have DejaGNU installed, you can verify the tool as follows
(otherwise omit this step):

     make check

Install the tool with:

     make install

This will install the library in _prefix_/lib, the demo programs in
_prefix_/bin, headers in _prefix_/include and the documentation in
_prefix_/share, where _prefix_ is the prefix specified when
configuring, if any.

The documentation may be created and installed in alternative formats
(PDF, Postscript, DVI, HTML) with for example:

     make pdf
     make install-pdf

File: pihwm.info,  Node: Library Usage,  Next: API,  Up: Library

2.1 Library Usage
=================

The library may be used by adding `-lpihwm' when compiling on the
_Raspberry Pi_.  Programs should include `pihwm.h' and any other
hardware specific headers from the `include' directory as required.
Note that if a prefix has been specified when configuring, it may be
necessary to specify the location of the library (using the `-L' flag)
and the headers (using the `-I' flag).

For example, running on the _Raspberry Pi_:

     gcc -I/opt/pihwm/include demo.c -L/opt/pihwm/lib -l pihwm -o demo

2.2.1 General API (pihwm.h)
---------------------------

The general API is found in the `pihwm.h' header, which should be
included before any other pihwm header.

 -- Defined constant: INPUT
 -- Defined constant: IN
     These are both `#define'd to the constant string `"in"'.


 -- Defined constant: OUTPUT
 -- Defined constant: OUT
     These are both `#define'd to the constant string `"out"'.


 -- Defined constant: HIGH
 -- Defined constant: ON
     These are both `#define'd to the constant string `"1"'.


 -- Defined constant: LOW
 -- Defined constant: OFF
     These are both `#define'd to the constant string `"0"'.


 -- Macro: debug (...)
     If the constant `DEBUG' is defined, then this maps directly to
     `printf(...)', otherwise it is empty.


 -- Macro: delay (D)
     This is defined as a synonymn for `sleep(D)'.

2.2.2 GPIO API (pihwm_gpio.h)
-----------------------------

The following functions are defined for driving the GPIO interface.

 -- Function: int gpio_init (int PIN, char *DIR)
     Initialize the GPIO interface for the pin numbered PIN on the
     _Raspberry Pi_ P1 header in the direction specified by DIR.  DIR
     should be either `"in"' or `"out"', for which the defined
     constants `INPUT', `IN', `OUTPUT' or `OUT' may be used.

     Returns 1 on success and -1 on failure.

 -- Function: int gpio_release (int PIN)
     The inverse of `gpio_init'. Frees the  pin numbered PIN on the
     _Raspberry Pi_ P1 header, so it can be used for other purposes.

     Returns 1 on success and -1 on failure.

 -- Function: int gpio_write (int PIN, char *VAL)
     Set the pin numbered PIN on the _Raspberry Pi_ P1 header to the
     value specified by VAL.  DIR should be either `"0"' or `"1"'.  The
     defined constants `LOW' or `OFF' may be used instead of `0' and
     `HIGH' or `ON' instead of `1'/

     Returns 1 on success and -1 on failure.

 -- Function: int gpio_read (int PIN)
     Read the value on the pin numbered PIN on the _Raspberry Pi_ P1
     header.

     On success, returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the pin is low or
     high respectively. On failure returns -1.

 -- Function: int gpio_set_int (int PIN, void (*ISR) (int), char *MODE)
     Set INT as the interrupt service routine (ISR) for pin numbered
     PIN on the _Raspberry Pi_ P1 header.  MODE should be one of the
     strings `"rising"', `"falling"' or `"both"' to indicate which
     edge(s) the ISR is to be triggered on.

     The function ISR is called whenever the edge specified occurs,
     receiving as argument the number of the pin which triggered the
     interrupt.

     Returns 1 on success. Never fails!

 -- Function: int gpio_clear_int (int PIN)
     Clears any interrupt service routine (ISR) set on the pin numbered
     PIN on the _Raspberry Pi_ P1 header. The ISR will have been set
     originally by a call to `gpio_set_int'.

     Returns 0 on success. Never fails!

In addition to the standard functions, a number of convenience
functions are provided, which follow the Arduino style.

 -- Function: int pinMode (int PIN, char *VAL)
     This is a synonym for `gpio_init'/

 -- Function: int digitalWrite (int PIN, char *VAL)
     This is a near synonym for `gpio_write', except that `"HIGH"' is
     mapped to `"1' and `"LOW"' is mapped to `"0' before passing VAL.

 -- Function: int digitalRead (int PIN)
     This is a synonym for `gpio_read'.

 -- Function: int attachInterrupt (int PIN, void (*ISR) (int), char
          *MODE)
     This is a synonym for `gpio_set_interrupt'.

 -- Function: int detachInterrupt (int PIN)
     This is a synonym for `gpio_clear_int'.

3 Demo Programs
***************

A number of demo programs are built with the library and may be found
in the _prefix_/bin directory.  Details of each demo, and the circuit
it drives are specified in the following sections.

The rest of this chapter will document the demo programs.

3.1 Setting up the  _Raspberry Pi_
==================================

For all these examples we are going to be using the _Raspberry Pi_
"headless", that is without its own keyboard, mouse and monitor. We'll
connect to it over Ethenet using the _secure shell_ (`ssh') program
from a terminal window on another computer.

All the examples will work just fine with the conventional setup with
keyboard, mouse and monitor. However you're quite likely to want to use
these circuits to control things like model cars or small robots, and
you really don't want to have to carry around anything more than a
battery.

* Menu:

* Setting up the SD Card::
* Setting up the Network::


File: pihwm.info,  Node: Setting up the SD Card,  Next: Setting up the Network,  Up: Setting up the _Raspberry Pi_

3.1.1 Setting up the SD card
----------------------------

The Occidentalis image can be found at

`http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2'.

Full details of how to put this on the SD card (it is not just a matter
of copying) for a range of operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) are
given at

`http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup'.

These is the short instructions for Linux. Run them from a shell.

  1. Unzip the image

  2. Use `df -h', then insert your SD card and rerun `df -h'. The new
     entries are the devices corresponding to your SD card. You'll
     probably see something like `/dev/mmcblk0p1' or `/dev/sdd1'. The
     `p1' or `1' are the partition number on the device, but we want to
     write the whole device, so we'll need to refer to it as
     `/dev/mmcblk0' or `/dev/sdd'

  3. We don't want anything else trying to write the SD card, so we now
     unmount it (leave it inserted). Use
          umount /dev/mmcblk0
     or
          umount /dev/sdd1

  4. Now use dd to copy the image to the device. Use the unzipped
     filename of the distribution and the device name _for the whole
     card_, not just the partition. For example:
          dd bs=4M if=Occidentalis_v02.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
     Change the filename and device name as appropriate.

     _Note._ This can take a long time (5-15 mins). You can check on
     progress by doing to another shell and running:
          sudo pkill -USR1 -n -x dd

  5. The image probably won't fill the entire SD card, particularly if
     it's large card. To fix this, use `gparted'. Run this and select
     the SD device (for example /dev/mmcblk0 or /dev/sdd). You'll see
     two partitions, one with a fat16 file system and one with an ext4
     file system. Select the ext4 partition and use
     Partition>Resize/Move to expand it to the maximum available size.
     Then use Edit>Apply Operations to change the size.


You now have an Occidentalis _Raspberry Pi_ image using all the space
available on your SD card.


File: pihwm.info,  Node: Setting up the Network,  Prev: Setting up the SD Card,  Up: Setting up the _Raspberry Pi_

3.1.2 Setting up the Network
----------------------------

The _Raspberry Pi_ Occidentalis SD card is set up by default to accept
SSH. The Ethernet interface will use DHCP to request an appropriate IP
address. You can then connect to that address. For example if the IP
address allocated was 192.168.0.77, you could use:

     ssh pi@192.168.0.77

However for this to work, you need to know which DHCP address has been
allocated to your _Raspberry Pi_ card. If you are just using your home
router, you can easily look to see what the value is. But in a more
secure network environment this may not be possible.

Any router can be set up, so that a particular _Raspberry Pi_
(identified by its "MAC Address") will always be allocated the same IP
address. In a school environment it might be appropriate to set this up
for a classroom set of boards, labelling each board with the IP address.

In a standalone environment, it is good to be able to work without a
full routed network. This is particularly useful when using a laptop
with a standalone environment. To make this change, two modifications
are needed:

  1. On the _Raspberry Pi_ edit the `/etc/networks/interfaces' file.
     Comment out the lines referencing DHCP and setting up the WLAN
     (use the `#' character at the start of each line).

     Then add the following lines.
          iface eth0 inet static
          address 192.168.2.2
          network 255.255.255.0
          gateway 192.168.2.1

     This sets the _Raspberry Pi_ up to have an IP address of
     192.168.2.2 and connect to a host machine with IP address
     192.168.2.1 You can use other numbers, but it it good practice to
     start with 192.168, and the address and gateway must only differ
     in the last number.

  2. Then on the host machine (e.g. a laptop), edit the network
     connections for the fixed network. Almost certainly this is set to
     automatic. Change to manual and specify the network address as
     192.168.2.1. Don't specify a gateway.

     You should now be able to connect the _Raspberry Pi_ to the host
     machine by Ethernet and use `ssh' to log in

          ssh pi@192.168.2.2

********************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
