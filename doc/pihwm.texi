@c Perhaps this should be the title of the document (but only for info,
@c not for TeX).  Existing GNU manuals seem inconsistent on this point.
@top Scope of this Document

This document is the user guide for @value{PIHWM}, the ligthweight C
library for Raspberry Pi hardware.

@node Preparation
@section Preparation

Unpack the software and create a @emph{separate} directory in which to
build it:

@example
tar jxf pihwm-@value{VERSION}.tar.bz2
cd pihwm-@value{VERSION}
mkdir bd
cd bd
@end example

Alternatively, the latest version software may be cloned from git:

@example
git clone git://github.com/embecosm/pihwm.git
cd pihwm
mkdir bd
cd bd
@end example

@node Configuring the Build
@section Configuring the Build

Configure the software using the @command{configure} script in the
main directory.

@example
../configure
@end example

There are several options available, many of which are standard to GNU
@command{configure} scripts.  Use @kbd{configure --help} to see all
the options.  The most useful is @code{--prefix} to specify a
directory for installation of the library.

@node Build and Install
@section Building and Installing
Build the tool with:

@example
make all
@end example

If you have DejaGNU installed, you can verify the tool as follows
(otherwise omit this step):

@example
make check
@end example

Install the tool with:

@example
make install
@end example

This will install the library in @emph{prefix}/lib, the demo programs
in @emph{prefix}/bin, headers in @emph{prefix}/include and the
documentation in @emph{prefix}/share, where @emph{prefix} is the
prefix specified when configuring, if any.

The documentation may be created and installed in alternative formats (PDF,
Postscript, DVI, HTML) with for example:

@example
make pdf
make install-pdf
@end example

@node Usage
@section Usage
@cindex running @value{PIHWM}

@value{PIHWM} is for use as a C library.  A separate chapter gives
details of how to use the library, and the API it implements
(@pxref{Library, , Library})

The library is supplied with a number of demo programs.  Details of
the programs and the hardware they drive are provided in a separate
chapter (@pxref{Demo Programs, , Demo Programs})

@node Known Issues
@section Known Problems and Issues

Full details of outstanding issues may be found in the @file{NEWS} file in
the main directory of the distribution.  At present there is no bug
tracker, so send details of any issues to the author.

@node Library
@chapter Library
@cindex usage and API of the @value{PIHWM} library.

The library may be used by adding @code{-lpihwm} when compiling on the
Raspberry Pi.  Programs should include @code{pihwm.h} and any other
hardware specific headers from the @code{include} directory as
required.  Note that if a prefix has been specified when configuring,
it may be necessary to specify the location of the library (using the
@code{-L} flag) and the headers (using the @code{-I} flag).

For example, running on the RaspberryPi:

@example
gcc -I/opt/pihwm/include demo.c -L/opt/pihwm/lib -l pihwm -o demo
@end example

This rest of this chapter will document the library API.

@node Demo Programs
@chapter Demo Programs
@cindex demo programs for @value{PIHWM}

A number of demo programs are built with the library and may be found
in the @emph{prefix}/bin directory.  Details of each demo, and the
circuit it drives are specified in the 

The rest of this chapter will document the demo programs.
